## Project Title
Katalog

## What and why?
Katalog is a website that aims to help Kpop fans build/sell their photocard collection. The website will have various pages each with different photocards. Each photocard page will show which users are selling or trading that photocard. Katalog also serves as a website to determine the current price value of a certain photocard.

Photocards are included in Kpop albums, but usually only a random member photocard is given. This in turn led to a huge trading market where fans trade for their favorite member's photocards. Typically, selling/trading is done through Twitter/Instagram or other social media platforms but this made it very hard to find certain photocards that you need for your collection. With Katalog, users can easily search for the photocard they need and look at who is selling/trading that photocard. Users can post listings of whether they are selling/trading that photocard.

## For whom?
This website is intended for Kpop fans who want to buy, sell or trade their various photocard collections. It also helps fans figure out what their collections are worth.

## How?
Users can create an account and connect to Twitter/Instagram
- An account will allow the user to list photocards up for sale/trade
- Additionally allows the user to keep track of which photocards are in their collection
- Also allow users to keep a wishlist of photocards they want
Users can navigate to the page of a certain photocard
- The page will have the image of the photocard and infomation about which album the photocard is obtained from
- It will also have a graph that illustrates the price over time
- The page will also show an add listing button for those who are logged in
  - The listing button will prompt the user whether they want to sell or trade, their location, if they are willing to ship worldwide, contact information (Twitter or Instagram etc)
  - If selling, you can list a price and shipping price. Also list prefer method of payment.
  - If trading, you can list photocards that you want in exchange

## Scope
This project is suitable for 4-6 programmers to work on because it requires implementation of a database and other features. Many more features can also be added if time permits. For example, a rating system which allows users who traded/bought from each other to give each other ratings based on how smoothly their transacation went. This will prevent scammers. In addition, a messaging system can be implemented so there won't be a need for contacting through social media platforms.
